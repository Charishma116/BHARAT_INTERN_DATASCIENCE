SMS CLASSIFIER:
I developed a model that classifies SMS as either spam or not using python 
This repository contains code for a machine learning project focused on detecting spam SMS messages. The project involves several steps, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), text preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment. It uses a dataset of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham (not spam) to train various machine learning models
